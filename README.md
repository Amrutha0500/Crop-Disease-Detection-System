# Crop-Disease-Detection-System
This is an Ensemble learning based Crop Disease Detection System 
🌽 Corn Leaf Disease Detection using Ensemble Learning
📝 Project Overview
This mini-project aims to develop an intelligent pattern recognition system using Ensemble Learning for detecting diseases in corn leaves. The project uses image data to train a machine learning model capable of classifying leaf images into various disease categories. The approach combines feature extraction, preprocessing, and a Bagging ensemble model with SVM to enhance classification accuracy.

🎯 Objectives
Build a robust classification model for corn leaf disease detection.
Apply ensemble learning using BaggingClassifier with Support Vector Machine (SVM) as the base estimator.
Evaluate the model using standard metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score.
Visualize the dataset and classification results for better understanding.

📦 Dataset Information
The dataset consists of images of corn leaves categorized into different folders: - blight: Corn leaves affected by blight. - rust: Corn leaves affected by rust. - healthy: Healthy corn leaves.

Note: The dataset is expected to be uploaded as a .zip file which will be extracted inside the notebook.

🔧 Setup Instructions (Google Colab)
Open the notebook in Google Colab.
Upload the dataset ZIP file when prompted:
from google.colab import files
uploaded = files.upload()
The notebook extracts the uploaded dataset:
import zipfile

for filename in uploaded.keys():
    if filename.endswith(".zip"):
        with zipfile.ZipFile(filename, 'r') as zip_ref:
            zip_ref.extractall("/content/Corn_Leaf_Disease_Dataset")
Proceed with training and evaluation.
🧠 Model Overview
🔄 Ensemble Method: Bagging Classifier
Reduces variance and avoids overfitting.
Trains multiple instances of base learners and aggregates predictions.
🔬 Base Estimator: Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
A powerful classification algorithm suitable for high-dimensional image data.
from sklearn.ensemble import BaggingClassifier
from sklearn.svm import SVC

model = BaggingClassifier(base_estimator=SVC(), n_estimators=10, random_state=42)
🔍 Preprocessing Steps
Image resizing
Grayscale conversion
Feature flattening
Label encoding using LabelEncoder
Train-Test Split (typically 80-20 split)
📈 Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy Score
Classification Report: Includes Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for each class
Confusion Matrix (optional addition)
Sample output:

              precision    recall  f1-score   support

     blight       0.92      0.91      0.91        50
     healthy      0.95      0.96      0.95        50
     rust         0.94      0.92      0.93        50

    accuracy                           0.93       150
📊 Visualization
Random sample images from dataset with labels.
Accuracy and loss trends (if training visualized over epochs).
Optional: Confusion matrix plot using seaborn or matplotlib.
📌 Notes
Designed to run on Google Colab for ease of use.
Ensure the dataset ZIP file follows the correct folder structure.
Can be extended by applying other ensemble techniques (Random Forest, AdaBoost).

📚 Future Enhancements
Deploy as a web or mobile app using Flask/Streamlit or React Native.
Extend to multi-crop disease classification using larger datasets.
Integrate with IoT devices for real-time field monitoring.
